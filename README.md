### CR Status Page

This is a status page that was created for CR in React. There are a couple open bugs that need fixin' and some enhancement requests pending.

The idea was to use a third party api for monitoring the actual applications and then the React app would just fetch the data.
The repo is lacking the API key so getting it started would be difficult if you pulled it down.

You can see it at https://status.callrevu.com though :)
